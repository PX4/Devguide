> **Info** Developers only! This guide is under active development and not intended for consumers.

This guide describes how to work inside the PX4 system architecture. It enables developers to:

* Get an [overview of the system](setup/config_initial.md)
* Access and modify the [PX4 Flight Stack](concept/flight_stack.md) and [PX4 Middleware](concept/middleware.md)
* Deploy PX4 on [IntelÂ® Aero Ready to Fly Drone](flight_controller/intel_aero.md), [Qualcomm Snapdragon Flight](flight_controller/snapdragon_flight.md), [Pixhawk](flight_controller/pixhawk.md), [Pixfalcon](flight_controller/pixfalcon.md) and many more autopilots.
