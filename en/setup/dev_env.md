# Installing Files and Code

PX4 code can be developed on [Mac OS](../setup/dev_env_mac.md) or [Linux](../setup/dev_env_linux.md). If unsure, new developers should default to the current [Ubuntu Linux LTS edition](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS).

> **Warning** A [Windows](../setup/dev_env_windows.md) toolchain also exists but is not officially supported - and we highly discourage its use. A virtual machine running Ubuntu Linux can be used for building code, but may not be suitable for Simulation/simulationd debugging. Before starting to develop on Windows, consider installing a dual-boot environment with [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com). 


## Development Environment

The installation of the development environment is covered below:

  * [Mac OS](../setup/dev_env_mac.md)
  * [Linux](../setup/dev_env_linux.md)
  * [Windows](../setup/dev_env_windows.md) (not recommended!)

If you're familiar with Docker you can also use one of the prepared containers: [Docker Containers](../test_and_ci/docker.md)
