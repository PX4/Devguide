# Development Environment on CentOS

The build requires Python 2.7.5. Therefore as of this writing Centos 7 should be used.
(For earlier Centos releases a side-by-side install of python v2.7.5 may be done. But it is not recommended because it can break yum.)

## Common Dependencies

The EPEL repositories are required for openocd libftdi-devel libftdi-python

```sh
wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm
sudo yum install epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm
yum update
yum groupinstall “Development Tools”
yum install python-setuptools python-numpy
easy_install pyserial
easy_install pexpect
easy_install toml
yum install openocd libftdi-devel libftdi-python python-argparse flex bison-devel ncurses-devel ncurses-libs autoconf texinfo libtool zlib-devel cmake
```

> **Note** You may want to also install  python-pip and screen

## GCC Toolchain Installation
<!-- import GCC toolchain common documentation -->
{% include "_gcc_toolchain_installation.txt" %}

## Additional 32 bit libraries

Once the arm toolchain is installed test it with:

```sh
arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
```
If you receive the following message

```sh
bash: gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_7-2014q2/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc: /lib/ld-linux.so.2: bad ELF interpreter: No such file or directory
```
Then you will also need to install other 32-bit libraries glibc.i686 ncurses-libs.i686

```sh
sudo yum install glibc.i686 ncurses-libs.i686
```

> **Note** Pulling in ncurses-libs.i686 will pull in most of the other required 32 bit libraries. Centos 7 will install most all the PX4 related devices without the need for any added udev rules. The devices will be accessible to the predefined group ' dialout'. Therefore any references to adding udev rules can be ignored. The only requirement is that your user account is a member of the group 'dial out'
