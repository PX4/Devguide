# Land Detector Configuration

The land detector is a dynamic vehicle model representing key vehicle states such as landed and ground contact.

## Configuring Auto-Disarming

By default the land detector does detect landing, but does not auto-disarm. If the hysteresis parameter `COM_DISARM_LAND` is set to a non-zero value the system will auto-disarm after N seconds \(the value it is set to\).

## Multicopter Land Detector Configuration

The complete set of parameters is available in the QGroundControl parameter editor under the `LNDMC` prefix. The key parameters that might differ per airframe are these:

* `LNDMC_MAN_DWNTHR` - the threshold \(in percent, default is 15%\) for how much manual throttle is allowed to be considering the state as landed. Systems with very high thrust-to-weight ratios like racers might need a lower setting here \(e.g. 8%\).
* `MPC_THR_HOVER` - the hover throttle of the system \(in percent, default is 50%\). It is important to set this correctly as it does not only make the altitude control more accurate, but also ensures correct land detection. A racer or a big camera drone without payload mounted might need a much lower setting \(e.g. 35%\).
* `MPC_THR_MIN` - the overall minimum throttle of the system. This should be set to enable a controlled descend.
* `LNDMC_THR_RANGE` - this is a scaling factor to define the range between min and hover throttle that gets accepted as landed. Example: If the minimum throttle is 0.1, the hover throttle is 0.5 and the range is 0.2 \(20%\), then the highest throttle value that counts as landed is the min throttle plus \(0.5 - 0.1\) \* 0.2 = 0.08, so a total throttle of 0.18.
* `LNDMC_POS_UPTHR` - throttle level to trigger takeoff \(in percent, default is 65%\). If the pilot raises above this threshold the system will attempt to take off. This value should be greater than the hover throttle.

## Fixed Wing Land Detector Configuration

The complete set of parameters is available under the `LNDFW` prefix. These two user parameters are sometimes worth tuning:

* `LNDFW_AIRSPD_MAX` - the maximum airspeed allowed for the system still to be considered landed. The default of 8 m/s is a reliable tradeoff between airspeed sensing accuracy and triggering fast enough. Better airspeed sensors should allow lower values of this parameter.
* `LNDFW_VELI_MAX` - the maximum velocity for the system to be still considered landed. This parameter can be adjusted to ensure a sooner or later land detection on throwing the airframe for hand-launches.
