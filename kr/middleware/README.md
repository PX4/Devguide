This section explains the PX4 middleware and architecture, 
including device drivers, mechanisms for communicating 
with offboard companion computers and GCS (e.g. MAVLink, RTPS), 
and the uORB publish-subscribe message bus. 

It also contains the [Modules & Commands Reference](../middleware/modules_main.md), 
which documents most PX4 modules, drivers and commands. 

> **Tip** For a detailed overview of the platform architecture see the 
> [Architectural Overview](../concept/architecture.md).
