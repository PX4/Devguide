# Installing Files and Code

The PX4 code can be developed on [Mac OS](starting-installing-mac.md), [Linux](starting-installing-linux.md) or [Windows](starting-installing-windows.md). Mac OS and Linux are recommended since image processing and advanced navigation cannot be easily developed on Windows. If unsure, new developers should default to Linux and the current [Ubuntu LTS edition](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS).

## Development Environment

The installation of the development environment is covered below:

  * [Mac OS](starting-installing-mac.md)
  * [Linux](starting-installing-linux.md)
  * [Windows](starting-installing-windows.md)

If you're familiar with Docker you can also use one of the prepared containers: [Docker Containers](advanced-docker.md)

Once finished, continue to the [build instructions](starting-building.md).
